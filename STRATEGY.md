## Communication Workflow & Implementation Constraints

### Claude vs Claude Code Division of Responsibilities

**This Claude Instance (Strategy & Planning):**
- ✅ **CAN**: Create comprehensive strategy documents, content outlines, keyword research guidance
- ✅ **CAN**: Analyze SEO best practices, create content calendars, define technical requirements
- ✅ **CAN**: Review progress via README updates and provide strategic adjustments
- ❌ **CANNOT**: Directly implement code changes, deploy websites, configure Azure resources
- ❌ **CANNOT**: Access live websites for real-time optimization or A/B testing
- ❌ **CANNOT**: Directly integrate with SEO tools like DataforSEO or Firecrawl

**Claude Code (Development & Implementation):**
- ✅ **CAN**: Implement actual website changes, deploy Azure infrastructure, configure technical SEO
- ✅ **CAN**: Integrate SEO tools, set up monitoring, create automated content systems
- ✅ **CAN**: Update README files with progress, challenges, and milestone achievements
- ❌ **CANNOT**: Receive real-time strategy guidance or ask clarification questions
- ❌ **CANNOT**: Access this strategic planning conversation for context beyond the published document

### Communication Flow Limitations

**Document-Based Strategy Transfer:**
- **Strength**: Complete strategy transfer in single, comprehensive document
- **Weakness**: No iterative refinement based on technical implementation discoveries
- **Mitigation**: Detailed technical specifications and alternative approaches in strategy document

**README-Based Progress Updates:**
- **Strength**: Clear milestone tracking and technical progress documentation
- **Weakness**: Delayed feedback loop - cannot adjust strategy in real-time
- **Mitigation**: Quarterly strategy review cycles based on README progress reports

**Repository Structure Communication:**
```
zimax.net (Private Repo) → README → Strategy Adjustments
aimcs.net (Public Repo) → README → Product Development Progress
```
