# Azure Front Door Security Hardening for zimax.net

## Overview
zimax.net is protected by Azure Front Door Standard/Premium, with a focus on enterprise-grade security and compliance. The configuration achieves an SSL Labs A rating and implements all modern best-practice HTTP security headers.

## Key Security Features

- **TLS 1.3 and 1.2 Only**: Legacy/insecure protocols are disabled. All modern browsers are supported.
- **SSL Labs A Rating**: Confirmed by Qualys SSL Labs, including strong ciphers and certificate chain.
- **HSTS Preloading**: `Strict-Transport-Security` header set to `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload` (2 years), making the site eligible for browser HSTS preload lists.
- **Security Headers Implemented**:
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`: Enforces HTTPS and enables HSTS preloading.
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`: Prevents clickjacking by disallowing the site in iframes.
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`: Prevents MIME type sniffing.
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`: Limits referrer data sent to other sites.
  - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`: Enables browser XSS filtering.
  - `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`: Restricts resource loading to the same origin.

## Implementation Details
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All security headers and routing rules are managed via Bicep templates, ensuring repeatable, auditable, and automated deployments.
- **Azure DevOps Automation**: Bicep deployments are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for zero-touch security updates.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: SSL Labs and securityheaders.com are used to validate configuration after every deployment.

## Why This Matters
- **Compliance**: Meets or exceeds requirements for GDPR, SOC2, and enterprise procurement.
- **User Trust**: Modern browsers show a secure padlock and block mixed content or insecure requests.
- **SEO**: Google and other search engines reward secure, well-configured sites.
